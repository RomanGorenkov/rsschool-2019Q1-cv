## Summary

I believe that I can be a great front-end developer. I have a passion for programming, which has not been extinguished over the years, and a love of web design, so frontend is my choice in web programming. I put a lot of effort into learning the basics of programming, and now I'm ready to put even more effort into becoming a good developer. I have a desire to learn and I will look for any opportunity to learn and apply new knowledge. I hope your team will help me in this long journey.

A small example of my code:

var count = 0;

  for (var i = 0; i < preferences.length; i++) {
  
    var firstLove = preferences[i];
    var secondLove = preferences[firstLove - 1];
    var thirdLove = preferences[secondLove - 1];
    
  	if (i + 1 == thirdLove && secondLove > i && firstLove - 1 > i) {
   
  		count++;
    
  	}
   
  }
  
  return count;
  
};
```
