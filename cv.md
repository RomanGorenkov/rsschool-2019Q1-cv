## Summary

I believe that I can be a great front-end developer. I have a passion for programming, which has not been extinguished over the years, and a love of web design, so frontend is my choice in web programming. I put a lot of effort into learning the basics of programming, and now I'm ready to put even more effort into becoming a good developer. I have a desire to learn and I will look for any opportunity to learn and apply new knowledge. I hope your team will help me in this long journey.
