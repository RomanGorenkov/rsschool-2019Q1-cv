## Summary

I believe that I can be a great front-end developer. I have a passion for programming, which has not been extinguished over the years, and a love of web design, so frontend is my choice in web programming. I put a lot of effort into learning the basics of programming, and now I'm ready to put even more effort into becoming a good developer. I have a desire to learn and I will look for any opportunity to learn and apply new knowledge. I hope your team will help me in this long journey.

  for (var i = 0; i < preferences.length; i++) {
  
  	if (i + 1 == preferences[preferences[preferences[i] - 1] - 1] && preferences[preferences[i] - 1] > i && preferences[i] - 1 > i) {
  		count++;
  	}
   
  }
  return count;
};
